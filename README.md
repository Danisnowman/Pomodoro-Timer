# Pomodoro Timer
Pomodoro Timer is an application that focuses on maximizing your productivity by using the *Pomodoro Technique*. The technique consists of periods of 25 minutes where the user works non-stop and without distractions. After said time, the user will have 5 minutes to rest and then it starts all over again. 

## Features
The app has the main Timer which works exactly as explained above and also has the ability to write down an objective and then tasks which themselves are attached to a specific objective. Tasks being attached to an objective means that when all tasks are done, the objective is finished. 

### To do list:
* ~~Implement Timer~~
* ~~Implement tab bar storyboard~~
* ~~Redesign~~ 
* ~~Refactor Storyboard~~ 
* ~~Enable the user to change task difficulty with stars rating system~~
* ~~Implement 5 minutes Recess on Timer~~
* ~~Implement *Long Recess* after 4 Pomodori~~
* Add checkbox (or equivalent gesture) to tasks to mark as *Done*
* Enable the user to add Objectives
* Add tree to make a relationship between Tasks and Pomodoro (how many tasks were completed in 25 minutes)
* Remove hardcoded data from objectives
* Remove hardcoded data from tasks

### Note:
Given that this app is in test mode, the current timer goes super fast. You can change it in *MainTimerViewController.swift*.
